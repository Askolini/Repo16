            <article>
                <p>This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t 
                    always easy.</p>

                        <strong>On programming</strong>
                        <p>Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top 
                            of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Why language matters</strong>
                        <p>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages. Programs looked something like this:</p>

                <p>Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and 
                    is thus fundamentally alike.</p>

            <article>
                <p>In this chapter, we will start to do things that can actually be called programming. We will expand our command of the JavaScript language beyond the nouns and sentence fragments we’ve seen so far, 
                    to the point where we can express meaningful prose.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Expressions and Statements</strong>
                        <p>In Chapter 1, we made values and applied operators to them to get new values. Creating values like this is the main substance of any JavaScript program. But that substance has to be framed 
                            in a larger structure to be useful. So that’s what we’ll cover next.</p>

            <header>Functions</header>
            <article>
                <p>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce 
                    repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Defining a function</strong>
                        <p>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. For example, this code defines square to refer to a function that produces the square of a given number:</p>
                        <code>
                        const square = function(x) {<br>
                                        return x * x;<br>
                                    };<br>
                                    <br>
                                    console.log(square(12));<br>
                                    // → 144<br>
                        </code>

                <p>Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of information require more than one atom, though. Objects allow us to group values—including other 
                    objects—to build more complex structures.</p>
